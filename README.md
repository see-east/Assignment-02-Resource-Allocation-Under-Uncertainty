ISYS 320U: Prescriptive Analytics - Assignment 2: Resource Allocation Under Uncertainty
I chose a resource allocation problem in my field of automotive advertising and created a small synthetic dataset (CSV) generated using a language model and contains 5 marketing channel options with their cost per 1,000 impressions and reach per 1,000 impressions, under a total budget constraint of $20,000. I built an optimization model, ran sensitivity analysis and validation, then responded to a stakeholder change of mind with an updated model and comparison. model and comparison. 

This project uses linear programming (PuLP in Python) to optimize the allocation of a $20,000 marketing budget across five channels (Social Media, Search, Display, Radio, CTV). The objective is to maximize total reach subject to budget and strategic constraints.
